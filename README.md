> Building the future of web development - one efficient page load at a time

## 🚀 Our Mission

We're building a **next-generation web development tool & browser** designed to revolutionize how the web works. Our goal is to make page loads more efficient with in-built design systems that save data, money, and the environment.

### The Impact

Every second, millions of web pages load across the globe. Each one consumes data, energy, and resources. By optimizing these loads, we're not just improving user experience - we're making a real environmental impact.

**Multiply efficiency gains by millions of page loads every day = massive positive change for our planet! 🌱**

## 🎯 What We're Building

Our next-gen web development tool and browser features:

- **⚡ Efficient Page Loading**: Dramatically reduce load times and bandwidth consumption
- **🎨 Built-in Design Systems**: Streamlined, consistent UI components out of the box
- **💰 Cost Savings**: Lower data usage means reduced costs for users and businesses
- **🌿 Environmental Sustainability**: Less data transfer = lower energy consumption and carbon footprint
- **🔧 Developer Experience**: Modern tools that make building for the web faster and more enjoyable
