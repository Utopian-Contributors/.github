> Building the future of web development - one efficient page load at a time

## 🚀 Our Mission

We're building a **web development tool & browser extension** designed to revolutionize how the web works. Our goal is to make page loads more efficient with locally served design systems and frameworks. This could save data, money, and the environment.

### The Impact

Every second, millions of web pages load across the globe. Each one consumes data, energy, and resources. By optimizing these loads, we're not just improving user experience - we're making a real environmental impact.

**Multiply efficiency gains by millions of page loads every day = massive positive change for our planet! 🌱**

## 🎯 What We're Building

Our web development tool and browser extension features:

- **⚡ Efficient Page Loading**: Dramatically reduce load times and bandwidth consumption
- **🎨 Built-in Design Systems**: Streamlined, consistent UI components stored inside the extension
- **💰 Cost Savings**: Lower data usage means reduced costs for users and businesses
- **🌿 Environmental Sustainability**: Less data transfer = lower energy consumption and carbon footprint
- **🔧 Developer Experience**: Modern tools that make building for the web faster and more sustainable
